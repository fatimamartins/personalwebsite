        <h2>Hello, I am <span>FÃ¡tima Martins</span> <br/>Front-end Web Developer</h2>
        <p>When I had to choose my degree in university, I chose Pharmaceutical Sciences because the field interested me. But especially when I entered the labor market, I realized that this was not a career I wanted to pursue for the rest of my live. Friends and family always told me I was very interested in how things work and had engineering blood running through my veins. So I decided to take a break and see if programming might be a good career path for me. I did a few courses online and even got a freelancing job doing HTML and CSS. As soon as I started creating beautiful websites all on my own, I knew that this is the path I want to follow.</p>
